ABSTRACT
The sharing of familiar foods is but one of the ways a cultural group identifies itself. But what happens if that cultural group begins to lose touch with, or control of, its food traditions? Worldwide, professional chefs are embracing traditional indigenous cookery techniques and ingredients in their search for national culinary identity. In doing so, the line between ownership and appropriation is becoming an increasingly fine one. Within today's Mori society, the hng is one of the few remaining traditional food preparation techniques still in regular use. Yet the use of its traditional earth oven form is growing more infre quent as less labor-intensive variations grow in popularity and as the technique becomes increasingly incorporated into commercial hospi tality practice. Drawing on research that explores the knowledge and personal experiences of seven hng practitioners, this paper examines the cultural significance of the hng as a traditional indigenous food preparation technique. As the hng increasingly crosses over into the commercial realm it questions the fine line between cookery technique and indigenous culinary property as it asks just what makes a hng a hng?

Introduction
Traditionally, kai (food) plays a prominent role in Mori culture. Mori food traditions can be said to extend back nearly 3000 years into the Pacific from whence the Polynesian settlers of New Zealand, the early ancestors of the Mori, arrived (Belich 1996). Oral traditions state that food descended from the atua (gods), and that it was through the actions of the atua Tmatauenga (god of war and humans) and his desire to seek utu (revenge) on his brothers for their cowardice, that kai was made noa (without restriction) and thus able to be consumed by humans (R. Walker 2004). This mythological connection has led to the harvesting, preparation and cooking of kai being surrounded by a series of spiritual, cosmological, and environmental beliefs and rituals (Moon 2005; Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Mori 2010; Williams 2013). The concept of manaakitanga (hospitality) plays a pivotal role in Mori social interac tion, wherein an obligation is placed on the host to provide food, sustenance, and hospitality to

a guest. In return, the host gains mana (status) from the exchange (Martin 2010; Mead 2003; Neill, Williamson, and Berno 2015).
One of the last traditional food preparation techniques still in regular use within Mori society is the hng, or earth oven ­ a cooking technique that utilizes a pit in the earth to cook food with steam and heat from pre-heated stones. Prior to European arrival, the hng was used daily as the primary technique for the cooking of kai (Burton 2009; Fitzpatrick 2007; Leach 2010). The introduction of European cooking techniques and oven apparatus has seen a gradual reduction in the use of hng (Belich 1996; Leach 2010). Today, hng are put down for hui (gatherings) or times of celebration and loss ­ particularly on the marae (complex of carved buildings and grounds that belong to a particular tribe). Increasingly, hng are now being put down outside of the marae space as part of fundraising activities or as the focus of special monetary events.
Within New Zealand there is a growing consensus amongst culinary art practitioners, influencers, and suppliers around the cultural, social, and economic benefits of defining what a contemporary New Zealand cuisine may look like (Clifford 2021; Latham 2021). As a result, interest in traditional Mori cookery techniques and ingredients is growing as chefs, both Mori and Pakeha (New Zealander of European decent), seek to incorporate aspects of New Zealand's indigenous heritage as they individually interpret what a New Zealand national cuisine may look like (Brett 2022; Fiso 2020; Ahi 2024; Thornber 2022). Alongside this is the increasing use of the hng for financial gain, bringing into question how indigenous culinary techniques are being incorporated into European structured hospitality frameworks. This change in purpose raises questions around indigenous food sovereignty and how the cultural importance imbued within these indigenous culinary techniques is being recognized and respected as these techniques increasingly take on a financial focus (Grey and Newman 2018; Huambachano 2018; Veracini 2022).

Materials and methods
Methodology
This research project was approached through a critical theory worldview. A hermeneutic phenomenological methodology, utilizing key informant interviews, provided the structure within which this research was conducted and analyzed. The entire research project was built around a Mori centered research approach (Cunningham 2000) which recognized the critical research aspects of Kaupapa Mori research theory (Mahuika 2008; Smith 1999). This research approach recognized that the project would be engaging with Mori knowledge (Mtauranga Mori) with its funda mental structure of wholism, connectedness and interdependence between the personal and the collective, and the physical and spiritual environments. In doing so, the project acknowledged the breadth and scope of Mtauranga Mori, its critical connection with the Mori identity and Te Ao Mori (the Mori world), and the value it places on the oral transmission of that knowledge and connection (Hikuroa 2017; Mead 2012).
The research team acknowledges that the Mtauranga Mori contained within this paper is not newly discovered but has simply been brought together into the one kete (basket), and unlike contemporary western thinking the knowledge contained in this kete is not owned by one individual but is held for the benefit of all ­ past, present, and future.

Participants
Data gathering was achieved using a series of semi-structured key informant interviews with seven participants. Participants were obtained by use of purposive sampling, based on the participants' first-hand knowledge of either preparing hng, or of organizing hui where hng have been used as the primary kai cooking technique. Of equal importance, the participants were required to have a strong connection to, or identify as, Mori. This was to ensure that the experience of participants relating to hng, either impacted on or were centered within a Mori cultural environment. Participants were informed that they would be identified by name and role within the final analysis. This is culturally important in terms of status, mana, and acknowledgment of mtauranga Mori (customary knowledge) (S. Walker, Eketone, and Gibbs 2006).
The seven participants who agreed to be interviewed for this research were: Riki Bennett  Te Arawa, Ngti Porou
Riki has facilitated workshops on traditional native plant use, and the making of mkihi (reed boats) and traditional rat traps and has presented at environmental conferences both in New Zealand and Australia. He has represented New Zealand at the Pacific Arts Festival in Palau Micronesia, speaking on traditional New Zealand native plant use. Riki has put down numerous hng, both for personal use and at many fundraising and corporate events. He is also a recognised expert in the making and use of taonga puoro. (traditional Mori musical instruments)
Stan Tawa  Ngti Twharetoa, Ngti Raukawa, Ngti Awa, Te Arawa
Stan is a professionally trained chef and culinary arts lecturer. In this role, he was instru mental in the founding of the Ng Kete e Toru--a programme which provided young chefs with an understanding of Mori culture, and tikanga (protocol) relating to food. He was also catering coordinator for Te Matatini 2015, an event that catered for approximately 7000 manuhiri (guests). Stan presented on the authenticity of the hng at the 2013 Council for Australasian Tourism and Hospitality Education (CAUTHE) conference.
Monique Fiso  Ng Rauru
Monique is a professional chef of Mori and Samoan descent. Having started her career in Wellington, she spent almost a decade in New York. Returning home in late 2015, she has begun work developing and refining traditional Mori cookery methods and promoting them into cutting edge cuisine in her own restaurant, Hiakai.
Brett McGregor  Te ti Haunui-a-Pprangi, Ngti Kahungunu
Self-taught, Brett has been putting down hng on a regular basis since the early 1990s. In his role as a caterer, Brett has provided catered earth cooked hng events for nearly all the marae of Tmaki-makau-rau. (Auckland)
Jason King  Waikato, Ngti Mahuta ki te hauuru
Jason is a Senior Lecturer at Te Ara Poutama, the Faculty of Mori and Indigenous Development at AUT, where his teaching areas focus on Mori language, leadership, and marae customs and protocols. Australian film-makers Matthew Salleh and Rose Tucker filmed Jason and his whnau (family group) as they demonstrated a hng being put down on their marae, Te Koraha, for inclusion in their documentary "Barbecue," which is now available to be viewed on Netflix.

Research questions While the interviews were conversational in tone, participants were asked two core questions to provide a repeatable structure across all seven interviews. The two research questions were:
RQ1: What are your experiences of hng?
RQ2: In what situations or in what contexts were your experiences of hng based?
Four further questions were then put to the participant as prompts over the course of the interview. They were:
RQ1: In your experience has the frequency of hng use changed?
RQ2: Has the reason for the use of hng changed?
RQ3: Was or is there any cultural significance beyond its use as a food preparation technique?
RQ4: Has the meaning behind the use of hng changed?

The Hng as a cultural learning space
It's not just a hng, it's not just cooking this food in the ground. (Stan)
Mori culture is traditionally built upon a complex layering of social, cultural, and quasireligious rules and guidelines (Mead 2003). These tikanga (correct procedure or custom) weave in and out of a person's life and provide them with guidance on a wide range of issues, such as kaupapa (policy), whakapapa (genealogy), wairuatanga (spiri tuality), and tapu (under protection, or sacred). As is the case with any cultural

knowledge and understanding, mtauranga Mori is passed on and learned in many formal and informal, active, and passive ways (Mead 2003; Salmond 1975).
Riki, Stan, Jason and Joe were all raised in rural Mori communities within whnau strongly connected with their marae. For them, hng were part and parcel of the Mori world in which they were brought up:
Well as a child, as a kid, hng was very much a part of our upbringing. (Riki Bennett)
Hng was a staple diet--hng and boil up, those two. (Jason King)
It was while immersed within this rich Mori environment that all four were exposed to the various aspects of tikanga that surrounded the hng:
We were taught it all--reo (language), whakairo (carving), waiata (song), mara kai (garden ing for food). It was a concentration of knowledge--all the mtauranga, tikanga. It was immersion, total immersion . . . You learned it because you were in it. (Joe McLeod)
For those interviewees brought up within a whnau (family group) of strong Mori cultural connections, the hng provided a platform around which issues and examples of tikanga were learned in a more informal environment. For example, before beginning the process of organizing and cooking a hng, thanks would be given, and protection sought from the atua. In doing so, the participants (as children observing this) began to under stand the concepts of whakapapa , wairuatanga, and Te Ao Mrama (the natural world). Through observing the selection and gathering of resources, they gained an understand ing of the importance of sustainability, of rhui (ritual prohibition), and the role of Papatnuku (earth mother), as the motherly provider.
All three acknowledged the connection between hng and whenua (the land). The resources of kai, wood, the earth, all the resources come back to the whenua and, thus, whakapapa back to Papatnuku and providing a strong physical and spiritual connec tion to the land, the land of their ancestors. Although hng was not the only way in which this connection was sustained, through its role in the production of food and sustenance, it did connect, and still does, in a very direct way.
The importance of manaakitanga is conveyed by the occasion, where the roles of host and guest are clearly defined. Understanding the concept of manaakitanga as a child, would become important in the future, when they would play a part in the formalities of the pwhiri or tangihanga (or "tangi," funeral):
I think about one of my aunties who passed away. Before she passed away, she gave me a call and said can you take care of the kai for us. I said it was a sad call to get, but I'll do that, Auntie . . . So, it's significant, and that's about the manaakitanga and those who are coming to support my family, and the hng was a very important aspect of that. (Stan Tawa)
All this knowledge was inherent within the process of preparing, cooking, and serving a hng. This knowledge learnt in their youth remains with them all, and they continue to live by those learnings.
Yet, within this environment the learning was not structured or defined; it was both active and passive. Children picked up knowledge through doing--helping to gather the resources, dig the hole and put down the hng, and then to serve and eat it. They also learned through observation--watching whnau prepare and cook hng, observing what was being done and how differing people reacted and responded:

FOOD, CULTURE & SOCIETY

As a young person, I'd watch my father and my uncles put down hng, and my grandfather as well put down hng. And you'd just ask questions about that, and my mother as well, just ask them because they all had different ways to do the hng. (Stan Tawa)
The hng itself as a technique is not particularly difficult and has relatively few steps, yet a successful hng relies upon knowledge gained through experience ­ how deep to dig the hole relative to the amount of food, the soil type and its dampness, knowing when the rocks are hot enough, and understanding the balance between the number and tempera ture of the rocks and the amount of food being cooked when judging the length of cooking time. What was observed in the interviews was that hng--as a central pillar of Mori kai ­ provides an environment rich in cultural learning:
So, the cultural significance would be in what I would call tikanga, that folded in at certain stages of the hng. (Jason King).
Through observation and participation, Riki, Stan, Jason and Joe grew up understanding their place within the whanau, and within tribal society. It was a form of cultural apprenticeship that allowed them to grow up with an understanding of their own world and culture ­ Te Ao Mori (the Mori world view). Simply put, hng provided a space in which they learnt to be Mori.
For Monique, Brett, and Paul, hng provided a gateway into Mori culture. In utilizing the hng as a cookery technique as a part of her professional career, Monique, who grew up within a predominantly Samoan cultural environment, has begun to explore the cultural knowledge that surrounds hng, and this has provided her with an introduction and a space from which she can explore Te Ao Mori in an informal way. Encouraged, Monique has begun a process of reconnection with Te Ao Mori, something that would have been unthinkable only a few years back. In doing so, she has gained a more complete understanding of her own Mori background and culture, and there is now pride rather than shame. Her exploration of hng has also led to a growing accumulation of knowledge. With this has come a desire to help preserve areas of mtauranga Mori, in particular, the cultural knowledge associated with kai that has begun to be forgotten, or is now consigned to the history books:
I know way more than I ever did in my entire life. What's been quite interesting is that I had no idea that there were all these different rules and protocols for cooking things, and now that I do, I approach things so differently. (Monique Fiso)
Brett's introduction to hng also came late in life. For Pkeh (New Zealander of European descent), the Mori world can at first be an intimidating one to enter. In Brett's case, while he does have whakapapa connections, he does not live within Te Ao Mori, and nor does he look recognizably Mori. In fact, he is known by some customers as the "ZZ Top guy," due to his resemblance to members from that band. The informal nature of the cultural space that surrounds the hng has, for business purposes, allowed him to straddle both Pkeh and Mori cultures:
Funnily enough, because I'm so pale when I turn up to a `do' (event/gathering) that's predominantly Mori there'll be two looks on their faces. One is "Why are these white guys turning up and I hope they know what they are doing." The other is the first question they ask, "Is this one of those steamers bro?" But each and every one of those guys have come back and said "Oh, that's choice." (Brett McGregor)

R. RICHARDSON

For Paul, who grew up in Invercargill with recently immigrated Samoan parents, the connection growing up was not to the hng, but to the "umu" (Pacific Island style earth oven). He sees connections between the umu and its place within Samoan culture, and the role of hng within Mori culture, and this understanding allows him to feel comfortable around hng and the cultural space it occupies.
To Paul, who already had a reasonable level of familiarity with Mori protocols and tikanga through both his wife and his business associations with Mori, hng has provided him with a space in which he can continue to grow his understanding of Te Ao Mori. But, arguably more importantly for Paul, the hng has provided a cultural learning space not for himself, but for his customers. The hng provides a single, simple tool through which he can introduce people to a vast expanse of Mori tikanga, culture and knowledge. Food can be a great leveler ­ we all eat, we all cook, and so we can all relate in some way to the hng. The basic concepts, of course, are not alien. Prepare the food, cook the food, eat the food together; every culture has something similar in their culinary repertoire. Unlike the pwhiri, which has more formal connotations and involves issues of mana, tapu and cultural appropriateness, the hng can be as relaxed as a family barbeque, even allowing for issues of tikanga. In the hng, Paul has an informal, non-confrontational space in which his business can interact culturally with both Mori and non-Mori customers.
The cultural space provided by hng differs, depending on a person's needs. For Riki, Stan, Jason and Joe, growing up with hng exposed them to the many aspects of mtauranga Mori that surround it and are folded through it. In doing so, it provided them with a space in which to explore and understand Te Ao Mori, and a punga stone (traditional weight) with which to anchor themselves to their culture, to the whenua, and to their whnau. In Monique's case, hng has provided a comfortable space in which she has been able to tentatively reengage with Mori culture. Backed by a confidence in her own high level culinary skill set, in hng and Mori kai she has found an environment in which she can feel safe and increasingly comfortable in exploring a culture that is both familiar and alien to her ­ her own. For Brett and Paul, while the hng provides a financial opportunity that taps into Mori culture, both are effectively `outsiders. The hng provides the two of them with a culturally safe space within which to enter and engage in Te Ao Mori.

The Hng as a social space
For Riki, Stan, Jason, and Joe, early hng memories revolve around the frequent social gatherings held at the marae. They stem from the feelings of a common bond that hng invoked; the working together of many people, of it being an "event." For them all, it was the sense of community that they remembered fondly; the "coming together of people," of whnau, the youthful excitement of the event and the sense of adventure, the sharing of resources, and of all pitching in together to make the event a success:
For me, a connection between the hng . . . it's more about the memories it evokes. So, when I think about hng I think about what we've done, and the circumstances that have brought the hng about. I remember and I think about the celebrations, but I also think about the sadness. (Stan Tawa)

FOOD, CULTURE & SOCIETY

All four commented that hng required resources that were not always readily or easily available, and they had strong memories that in their youth, it was a communal task to gather them. Tribal or whnau members would be allocated tasks, and others would offer resources, such as food or wood, or manpower. Thus, a sense of community was formed, one of reciprocity for the greater good, and of contributing to something bigger than oneself ­ whnau. For them, these were fun times remembered fondly and missed. Today their experiences of hng are different. Organized events are infrequent, and by natural extension, so are the number of hng. Events held on the marae today are smaller, and tend to also be shorter in duration. Tangi, for example, are now usually held on only one day, rather than the traditional three. In some cases, whnau and friends no longer have the same access to resources owing to the changing structure and makeup of rural communities. In all cases, the tribal base has become either smaller, or more scattered, and in many cases it is simply a case of there no longer being enough people available to put down the traditional earth hng:
You used to get 30­40 people go down and grab all of it and come back with 30 kete (baskets) full of pipis (clams) then pour it on. We don't have those numbers nowadays, unless they organize a specific event to do that, but that's not commonly seen now.(Jason King)
What all participants did agree on, however, was that the social environment surround ing the marae has changed. The result of these social changes is that for each participant associated with a marae, the cooking on their marae is now undertaken using modern catering equipment and/or artificial hng cookers:
What's happened and what's evolved is their whare kai (cooking and eating house) burnt down. So, they got a brand-new whare kai, but they've got a brand-new whare kai with combi therms, Bratt pans, you know. So, all that stuff with the hng unfortunately . . . they still have a hng pit there, but it's just not utilized. (Paul Retimanu)
This modern equipment speeds up the process of catering to the whnau and manuhiri, making it more time-efficient for the volunteers, which is an important consideration at a time when it is difficult to obtain volunteers. Today the social space that the hng occupies has changed. When any of the interviewees do put down a hng, it is more likely to be as a fundraiser for others, or as a financial opportunity, rather than as an event for themselves and their whnau. In this way, the focus has changed from hng being a natural part of an event, to the hng being the event itself. Where once hng provided a technique in which large amounts of food could be produced for a tangi, wedding, or birthday, today it is more likely that the event has been organized with the sole intention of celebrating or highlighting the hng technique. It has become a situation whereby it is the hng itself that people are there for.
There are exceptions. Brett continues to provide earth hng to those requiring catering for a large number of people at an event, and for whom the hng provides a required cultural link. He also continues to provide hng for many of the marae of Tmaki-Makaurau (Auckland) and is unsure whether any of its marae put down a traditional hng themselves anymore:
I've been around to Te Unga (marae name) three times. One time I went out there, these young fellas, these young bucks, are hanging around and I said to the lady ``You've got

788

R. RICHARDSON

a hng pit out the back there, why don't you get those young fellas to do it?'' She said getting them to do work is near impossible. I said that I bet they come out of the woodwork when the kai is on the table. (Brett McGregor)
This, of course, has created a niche for him to fill, but may also possibly reflect the lack of resources available to urban marae. While rare, in the experiences of Riki, Stan, Jason and Joe, rural marae do still put down traditional earth hng, if only once a year or so. Even this, however, they acknowledge is a significant undertaking. Gone are the days when a hng could be organized with a phone call, and the old networks and systems all quickly swinging into action. It takes a lot more organizing now. As Brett acknowledges, it is much easier for a marae committee to ring him and have a hot hng delivered the next day. In fact, Brett once received a call mid-morning to the effect that a local marae needed a hng for several hundred-people, cooked for six pm that evening. Members of the marae in question had attempted to organize their own hng, but come the day, had failed to obtain all the necessary resources. Brett managed to arrive on site with ten minutes to spare. That particular marae is now a regular customer of his.
Of the others, Joe and Riki continue to provide regular hng as fundraisers for events, or as educational experiences. Already well-involved in promoting other aspects of Mori culture through their professional lives, for Riki and Joe, their continuing involvement with hng is simply a part of who they are. Jason and Stan only occasionally put down hng these days. Jason's most recent hng have been for a documentary, and for AUT as part of their overseas cultural program. While hng may not be the regular occurrences they once were, both Stan and Jason make an effort to remain actively involved in marae activities. They both believe it is vitally important that their tamariki (children) and mokopuna (grandchildren) understand and feel connected to their whakapapa, and that this won't happen if they, as parents, do not facilitate it. Both Monique and Paul regularly put down hng, but theirs are for financial and professional benefit, and the focus of their events are on the hng itself ­ generally as a celebration or promotion of Mori kai. In all cases, hng put down specifically for family and friends are the exception, rather than the rule:
I haven't done one for a while or so . . . I've still got all the resources. I probably could do them as often as I wanted, but I don't want to. (Stan Tawa)
It seems that without the incentive of financial gain, putting down a hng today is seen as too much like hard work. If you want to get the family together, it is much easier to simply fire up the gas barbecue.

When is a hng not a hng?
From its origins in the Pacific, the hng as a technique has constantly evolved or been adapted to suit its user's needs. As the hng adapted to Aotearoa, deeper and larger holes were dug to retain the heat needed to cook the larger cuts of protein found here, while native plants and berries were identified and added for flavor. The introduction of wire baskets in place of rourou (flax baskets), and the incor poration of iron, in place of stones, has occurred more recently. There are now many artificial hng cookers available, all of which attempt, with varying degrees of

FOOD, CULTURE & SOCIETY

789

success, to imitate the earthy, smoky flavor of the traditional earth hng. This, though, raises the question of what is truly a "traditional hng," or even if there is still such a thing:
I don't know if the hng I put down is authentic in any way shape or form because of the fact that things change, things evolve. (Stan Tawa)
These days, when discussions turn to hng (of any kind), and the food that is prepared in them, the expectation is of the classic "meat and three vegetables," usually pork, potatoes, kmara (sweet potato) and pumpkin, and perhaps a little more. Yet, the growing move ment toward a "New Zealand" cuisine is prompting a rethink of traditional Mori kai and culinary techniques. For Monique, the hng offers an opportunity for culinary experi mentation. In her experience, there is growing interest from young chefs in hng and other traditional Mori culinary techniques. But if our young chefs have become increas ingly inspired by the hng, this poses the question of how they learn how to prepare it, and who is entitled to teach it.
It will always survive and there will still always be those people who are "this is what hng is." But we just need more people passing their knowledge along - something that Mori, particularly of an older generation, are not good at. It's a case of, "this is ours, it's our culture, we are not going to share it with you or the Chinese guy that just got here." (Monique Fiso)
In Monique's view, this does not necessarily mean that hng must stay entirely within Mori ownership:
If we are just going to continue this whole "you have to be Mori to do it" then it's going to die along with a whole lot of other things that have died and a lot of knowledge that has already been lost. (Monique Fiso)
In her professional eyes, the hng is at once both simple and complex. The technique itself is straight-forward, but if thoughtfully used, can result in food of textural and flavor complexity. This leaves it well-suited for use within a fine dining or haute cuisine setting. It is this transition, the elevation of hng from a simple home-cooked style of meal to a dish that the world's diners would seek out, and just as importantly pay well for, that excites her.
With his business operations strongly influenced by tourism, Paul sees a similar future for hng. He feels that the future is all about broadening its appeal while still maintaining its cultural links. "Why," he asks, "is our indigenous food seen as something cheap?" His belief is that as long as the hng is viewed as something that comes in tin foil for $10, a business like this will never be able to utilize it as a cookery technique, and as long as customers' perceptions of hng remain that way, it won't be financially viable. For hng to work in a café restaurant operation such as his own, Paul's belief is that hng needs to be seen as a value-added product, that the six-hour cooking process and the food cooked in it are worth paying for. This is a belief shared by both Riki and Monique:
I was like, why have we just stopped and gone well this is hng, its comes in a tray and is $10 a pop. (Monique Fiso)
They turn up somewhere and get the food and they walk away. They get it plated up for them. They don't actually see the work that's gone into it beforehand. Because there is a lot of work that goes into it. (Riki Bennett)

Paul's belief is that this attitude can be shifted by using higher quality produce and moving away from the traditional fatty pork, potatoes and kmara recipe. As he points out, New Zealand is well known as a producer of high-quality food products ­ people overseas are willing to spend top dollar on the New Zealand food brand. In his view, the hng itself is already a draw card due to its rarity, and fits in well with current trends of cooking over fire:
You notice it down here. As soon as we light the fire people gravitate towards it. It's a big thing ­ particularly blokes and barbeques. Fire, we love fire. Kids love fire. Everybody loves fire. (Paul Retimanu).
His belief is that if you can combine the two, New Zealand's high-quality produce and the very on-trend use of fire for cooking, then New Zealand food is on to a winner. Riki, along with his business partner, is also exploring the commercial side of hng. They already provide hng commercially for fundraisers and events on an intermittent basis, and it is their belief that offered in the right way, hng can be a healthy everyday option ­ something to replace the kiwi roast dinner. For Riki and his business partner, it is all about making good hng accessible every day.
Stan, Joe and Jason believe that the future of hng lies with the marae, although, all three are concerned over who will pass the knowledge on. In their own experiences, the number of Mori remaining connected to the marae is dwindling, and marae themselves are naturally moving toward quicker food preparation techniques and equipment. All of this impacts on the number of times a hng is used. As a result, the number of Mori with knowledge of preparing hng is declining, and there are differing views on how to prevent this. Both Stan and Jason believe that the knowledge will remain alive if people remain connected to the marae, but both acknowledge the difficulty people face in doing so:
Our philosophy is always to make sure the boys are connected to their land, to their marae all the time. And it's a lot of effort from the parents. Now if the parents aren't connected then bye-bye, bye-bye to that generation, that whole generation, that legacy. (Jason King).
For Stan, as a culinary arts lecturer, the issue of knowledge transfer is a familiar one:
It's a valid question, how do we keep it alive? Who are the kaitiaki (guardians)? Who are the ones who become a guardian for it, and is there a need for that? Perhaps there is. Maybe that's a question we need to ask. (Stan Tawa)
Neither Riki, Stan nor Jason had ever really given thought to the future of the hng, and the possibility that it could slowly disappear, prior to having the question posed by the researcher. While all three are well aware that hng are no longer being used as often as they had been in the past, all three were quick to grasp the connection between what the gradual disappearance of the hng would mean in regard to its associated knowledge and social value. It is this potential loss of mtauranga Mori that concerns them the most; they do not believe that the loss of the technique would be in any way an issue.
Joe, on the other hand, is quite clear about where knowledge of hng will reside in the future. He sees the future of hng as being digital. To that end, Joe is currently recording a series of instructional videos that share his knowledge and skills. It is his hope that by placing them into the digital world, the knowledge and skill will be recorded for posterity,

and easily accessible to those who seek it. Joe's view is that this type of change is a sign of the times ­ people are busier, kids live in a digital age ­ and if you want to keep people connected with Mori culture, it should be easily accessible. Unfortunately, for many Mori, and even more so for Pkeh, this type of knowledge isn't accessible whilst it remains solely on the marae.
None of the interviewees were particularly concerned about the rise of hng sub stitutes, or its eclipse by modern catering equipment. Most saw this as a natural progres sion, or as a reflection of the times. The greater concern was around the loss of associated knowledge surrounding the hng. Asked whether a hng cooker was a true hng, all paused. For the participants in this study, in terms of the status of an event, no-one felt that an event at which a hng was put down traditionally held more significance than one that didn't. Stan and Jason both hesitantly agreed that the rarity of the earth oven hng did imbibe an event with a greater feel of occasion, but not to the same extent that they remembered from their youth. The most important consideration (agreed by all) was upholding manaaki (hospitality) through the offering of food, regardless of how the food was cooked:
The key culturally, it's about feeding your manuhiri--you have to feed your visitors, and that's where your mana is . . . the key is that you'll feed the people that come, and how you feed them is up to you. (Stan Tawa)
Still, not one of the participants would say unequivocally that a hng cooker of any type was a true hng. Jason commented on a recently watched cooking program where a hng cooker had been used:
As I was watching that, a few things came into my head, and the first one was where is the community? There was only one guy making a hng, and if you come back to the ethos of the hng, it's about bringing people and communities together. (Jason King)
Joe and Paul had no issue regarding the use of the steamer type hng and acknowledged the practical nature of them, particularly in the commercial setting of a café or restaurant. But both believed you had to be upfront about the food cooked in it not coming from a true earth oven ­ to mislead a customer about just how the hng was truly cooked was in their view, dishonest, although, both thought that anybody with experience with food from a true earth oven hng would spot the difference between that and an artificial cooker straight away. A key area of hesitancy in calling the artificial hng cookers a "hng," was simply the fact that the food was not cooked in the ground. Asked whether hng was a technique, or whether it was a coming together of people, Monique's response focused on the technique. In her eyes, the lack of technique required by artificial hng cookers meant that they were not hng. She felt that the lack of technique translated into a lack of knowledge. Without the cultural knowledge (the mtauranga Mori) when using an artificial hng cooker, the food was simply being cooked, and nothing more.
So now because people just put it into a box, in tinfoil, I'm always a bit skeptical. I've always put my hng down in the ground, always. (Stan Tawa)
This acceptance, yet reluctance, behind the views of all participants regarding the use of artificial hng, perhaps provides the clearest understanding of the cultural value that all

792

interviewees place on traditional hng. They were at pains to point out that food from an artificial hng is not as good as the earth-bound hng, and that this is not what they expect from "hng;" also, that it is not what they grew up with. For all seven participants, hng has played or continues to play a fundamental role within their lives. For some, that role was in their childhood, shaping their cultural development and influencing their own personal views on their culture. Today, hng continues to provide a cultural reference point that strongly influences how some of the participants pass their culture on to their children. Others have been attracted by the financial opportunities that are offered by providing hng; these participants have also gained entry, in varying degrees, to Te Ao Mori. For hng is not simply a cookery technique ­ it is knowledge, it is whakapapa, it is culture. In New Zealand, the hng is unmistakably Mori. When you enter the world of the hng you enter Te Ao Mori.

Limitations of the study
Within this type of study, the text is formulated through interviews led by the researcher. In doing so the researcher is, to a certain extent, a co-creator of the text they are then interpreting. As such, the researchers' position within the study, and how it is interpreted and reported must be kept in mind when evaluating the data analysis and conclusions presented. The researcher is himself a male Pakeha chef lecturer married into a family who whakapapa to Ngi Tahu. While every effort has been undertaken by the researcher to ensure the emotional, spiritual, and physical comfort of the interviewees during this research project, the possibility of their not being so was always present and could have influenced the research project; it therefore needs to be mentioned.

Conclusion
This paper set out to explore the cultural significance of an indigenous food preparation technique ­ the contemporary earth oven hng as used within Mori society. Indigenous food and foodways has become an increasingly rich area for academic study, particularly in the food studies space. Yet, previous academic research on earth ovens, both in New Zealand and within the wider Pacific region has tended to focus on either the application or mechanics of the technique itself (Black and Thoms 2014; Huebert, Allen, and Wallace 2010; Messersmith 2012; Thoms et al. 2015) or the archeological aspect (Carson 2002; Leach 1981; Morrison et al. 2022). Wider academic literature on traditional pacific indigenous food tends to focus on foodways and ingredients, either with an eye to their potential commercial value (Cambie and Ferguson 2003; Jefferson 2021), within the context of colonization (Neill, Williamson, and Berno 2015; Santich 2011; Veracini 2022; Wessel 2019; Wessell 2017; Williamson and Neill 2014), or through a health promotion lens (Divarkarla, Aroni, and Sutherland 2020; Ferguson et al. 2017; Lopes et al. 2023; Rush et al. 2010). This focus on ingredients tends to mean that the cultural role played by traditional cookery techniques that utilize these ingredients gets overlooked.
At the core of this research, sat the question of just what transforms an earth oven into a hangi. The earth oven itself is not unique to New Zealand or to Mori ­ its use in various configurations has been well documented around the world (Black and

FOOD, CULTURE & SOCIETY

793

Thoms 2014) ­ and since its arrival in Aotearoa the hng has continued to evolve (Burton 2009; Tawa 2013). But regardless of the form it takes, what this research arguably highlights is the slowly changing nature of hng use ­ becoming less frequent within its traditional cultural role but increasingly being utilized as part of a financial transaction within a wider commercial hospitality context. All the parti cipants in the study recognized and acknowledged this change. Some saw it as a natural progression, an opportunity to be embraced. Others were more wary, concerned over the potential loss of the very thing that made a hng more than just a simple earth oven. For them, an earth oven only truly becomes a hangi when it is situated with Te Ao Mori ­ the Mori world ­ and enrobed in kaupapa and practices of tikanga and manaakitanga. The hng is, at its heart, a social gathering space. This is, of course, not surprising. Food is a subject around which people congregate, talk, and share stories ­ a place to reconnect culturally, socially, and mentally (Appadurai 1988; Fischler 1988, 2011; Kittler, Sucher, and Nelms 2017; Sobal and Nelson 2003).
The shift toward hng being utilized more frequently for monetary gain brings financial opportunity no different than that of any other cooking method. Yet, the concern shown over the potential lack of cultural involvement raises questions around how indigenous culinary techniques can be incorporated into commercial hospitality practice without losing what it is that makes them unique indigenous culinary practices in the first place, and secondly, who is allowed to do so. Speaking in commercial terms, the cultural significance of the hng is the intellectual property of Mori and is a part of "brand Mori" ­ as is the umu to the Samoan people or the lovo to Fijians, to give just two examples. When these types of culinary techniques are removed from their cultural context and placed into western structures, particularly for financial benefit, then con cerns over cultural appropriation and colonization are justified (Harmsworth et al. 2013; Love and Hall 2022).
If we take Grey and Newman's (2018) framework for the colonization of a food culture, it could be argued that the New Zealand culinary landscape has moved past the initial stage one of suppression (see Morris 2010), and having quickly skipped through the authenticity seeking plurality of stage two, is now entering the third and final stage of convergence, or creolization, as Mori and Pacific food becomes increasingly incorporated within the menus of New Zealand hospitality venues (Brett 2022; Fiso 2020; Thornber 2022). Veracini (2022) points to Levi-Strauss in stating that a societies way of cooking expresses its foundational structures when discussing the decolonization of cuisine and argues that we need to be wary of allowing a situation whereby the colonizer feels comfortable as the host "allowing" indigenous cuisine a place at the table. In much the same vein, Grey and Newman (2018) argue that it is well within the rights of Indigenous Peoples to withhold gastronomic capital in response to this assimilation and commodification. They make the point that food is and should be treated as political. As we move forward, discussion around the decolonization of cuisines will only increase and it will be important to remember that indigeneous cuisine is not limited to its traditional ingredients, but also to the techniques traditionally used to prepare them. As seen in this paper, these techniques are often immersed in culturally significant practices and beliefs. For Indigenous Peoples, allowing the natural evolution of their culinary

intellectual property whilst still ensuring the continuation of the cultural practices and values which make these very techniques unique, and thus commercially valuable, will become an increasing challenge.
